<h1>The Best Movies According to Sundar Kandel</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies Of All-Time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious. <br/> 
    <br/> The film is directed by Christopher Nolan.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<br>A mind and reality bending movie. With humanity teetering on the brink of extinction, a group of astronauts travels through a wormhole in search of another inhabitable planet. </br> 
<br/>Again, the movie is from Christopher Nolan.</p>
<h3>Mad Max- Road Fury</h3>
<p> In a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a woman rebels against a tyrannical ruler in search for her homeland with the aid of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshiper and a drifter named Max. <br/>
    <br/> A Must-Watch Tom Hardy Movie.</p>
